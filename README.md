# ML-FaceReco
Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time. In python face_recognition is a command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line. Through the face recognition module, we are able to read the images from the desktop and identify the images through technique called face encoding. For face recognition to be successful the algorithm notes certain important measurements on the face like the color and size and slant of eyes, the gap between eyebrows, etc. All these put together define the face encoding the information obtained out of the image that is used to identify the particular face and thatâ€™s the reason why we settle for face encoding after loading the image from the dataset.
